Venn
====

Small Javascript app for drawing dynamic, no-images-used venn diagrams

Requires a modern browser that supports box-shadow

To modify the size and overlap of the venn circles, modify the object in venn.html
  
This code was specific to a project where the diagram was comparing the things in common between two users and the vars reflect that.

TODO: Make this more generic
